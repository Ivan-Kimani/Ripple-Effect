    Raising girls……
Last week as my daughter and I were cleaning the dishes and listening to loud music, some old school 90's jams, as I told her tales of how we used to put on bandanas as swag…. She looked at me and shouted above the music.

Daughter: mum, I am not getting married.

Me: Jesus Christ of Nazareth, come and don't send anyone (Ps. Say this in your mother tongue it will have a better effect). why on earth would you say such a thing?
 
Daughter: mum, you are single and raising us and doing a good job without a man present.

Me: waaaa…akiiii… you have stopped reggae…, Say what now!! But I want 6 grand kids.

Daughter: mum, you need to deal!

My heart and my mind are all speaking in tongues at this moment. What do I say to this child to tell her that having a man by your side is a good thing.

Here I am 40 plus, and I have moved heaven and earth to be able to take care of them emotionally, physically, financially and all the ally's you can think of, and I still feel I have failed miserably.

Mum has been the plumber, the cook, the therapist, the teacher, the friend, the doctor, the go to person, the enemy, and the priest of the home. Their world has revolved around mum.

How do I articulate the importance of a man. They don't know how to live with a man, iron a trouser, tie a tie, how to take care of man, let alone be a wife.

How can I remedy this problem, without having to drag a clueless dude to the alter?
I am not about to tell her she doesn't need a man because that will be a big fat lie.

Any insights? Any father figures in the house? Help……I need answers, “ndingehota”….

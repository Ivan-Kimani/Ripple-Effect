    The Juggling Act...
Single parenting requires tenacity, wisdom, and resilience. It's just you trying to figure things out as you go along.

The other day my workmate gave me a peculiar job title. Chaos Coordinator... Aka a multitasker who solves problems no one else can, Mrs. Fix it. This title came about during one of those days that everything was falling apart. On this particular day, I was greeted by a discouraged team. "Client wants this miracle done and we know it's not possible". At this point my phone is buzzing non-stop…, and guess who? It was the client, who wanted to give me a mouthful of what they think should happen. I managed to somehow calm the storm and get consensus.

At around mid-day I get a call from the kids;
Kid1 : the tube light in the kitchen is flickering, my shower is not removing hot water and I saw a really cool dress online I want.

Kid 2: there is nothing to eat..(mark you the fridge is full of githeri, njahi and beans, my friends is that not food?)

Kid 3: remember on Saturday you promised to take us to the mall for shopping and please don't say you finished money or you are tired.

The only thing I could respond was, “ I will sort everything when I get home”.

As I sat at my desk I wondered, who do I call to tell my problems? Who can take on some tasks? Who is taking care of me? And by the way where am I in all this?

When I arrived home in the evening, tired to the core and craving to jump into bed. I open the door to excited humans all wanting to tell me how their day was. As I sit there trying so hard to listen I hear my phone buzz and I see a text from the client, "this was not done, what are you doing about it?

When I finally hit my pillow I called my mum. 
Me: mum, I can't do this, I say balancing tears.

Mum: Sandra it's okay not to be okay. You are allowed to drop some balls. You are only one person. Remember the song I taught you. "One day at a time, sweet Jesus....listen to it now...
That night only my pillow has the other version of what happened...

Lessons learned:
1. Take time for you: to listen to you and have a conversation with you about you. Trust me it works.

2. If you are carrying ten balls and you drop 5, appreciate the 5 you have managed to save.
Share insights on how you manage to juggle the balls in your life.
As Sandra the Resilience Builder I always say:
Where there is a will, there's a way

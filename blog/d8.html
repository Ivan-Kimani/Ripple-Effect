    Do you know the song by the Beatles that goes….
Let it be… let it be…let it be…. let it be…there will be answer, let it be….

There was a time I my life I found myself in my darkest hour, we had no food, landlord at the door kicking me out and my son would wear a trouser till it became a short.
The last straw was during that Christmas season, my son was outside playing, he came in very sad and asked.

Son: mum, we don't have Christmas in our house. How come you have not bought me new clothes or shoes or toys? How come we don't eat meat or sausages like my friends do.

My heart broke into a thousand pieces, at the time he was asking me this, we didn't have food for super. I run into the bedroom to cry my heart out, the pain in my heart was unbearable. If pain were to be measured or put in jars mine would have filled ten thousand jars. How do I explain to this 10-year-old that I have no penny to my name nor super to give him that night let alone new clothes.

As I sat there puffy eyed, I remembered what my mum had once said to me…
Mum: Sandra, it is when you are still, that you see the direction of the wind.
I whispered to my heart, be still.

A few hours later a friend called and told me that they felt led to buy me something for Christmas. As she waited for an answer my head was spinning with all the things, I wished for but had not seen in ages…ice cream, chips, sausage, meat. The list in my head was endless. The only words that came out of my mouth were,” just bring me as the spirit leads. I later heard a knock at the door and there was my friend, hands full of shopping bags; fruits, sausages, meat, and cereals.

Today I look at my son, taller than me and having clothes to change into and I know we have come from far. I sometimes worry about his future and if I will be able to provide for him, but then I remind my heart…be still…

This week I just want to encourage all of us who are struggling and battling one thing or another.
Let it be…there will be an answer….”

As Sandra the resilience builder I always say:
where there is a will there is a way…

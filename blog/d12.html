<p class="post-text">
    As a working single mother, it can be incredibly challenging to balance the demands of a career and the needs of your children. It's natural for your kids to want your attention and to feel jealous when you have to work long hours or travel for business. However, it is natural to feel guilty as well for the time and attention they need and deserve, and that you have not given.

    One way to address this issue is to set clear boundaries and make sure your children understand that you have to work to provide for the family. You can also make an effort to set aside dedicated time for your children, whether it's by making a special breakfast on the weekends or having a weekly game night.
    
    It's also important to remember that it's okay to ask for help. Whether it's enlisting the support of a trusted family member or hiring a babysitter to give you a break, there are many ways to ensure that your children are well taken care of while you're working.
    
    Ultimately, it's important to recognize that being a working single mother can be a challenging and rewarding experience. By setting clear boundaries and seeking out support when you need it, you can create a healthy balance that allows you to be the best mother and professional you can be.

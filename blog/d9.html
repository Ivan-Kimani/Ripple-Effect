<p class="post-text">
    My daughter finished her A level exams last year and despite her sleepless nights and dipping her feet in cold water to study she didn't get the marks she hoped for.

    As a mother you don't want to be on the receiving end of a teenager who feels she is a failure and will not amount to much. If you ask me exams should be abolished..don't stone me... conversation for another day.
    
    As she cried her little heart out telling me how she had failed me, I was feeling helpless and my heart sunk. Despite me telling her marks don't define her, this is just the beginning....blah blah blah is all she heard, her mind was just stuck on.. I have failed and my life will amount to nothing.
    
    As I sat there wondering what to tell my little girl and seeking wisdom I remembered our all time favorite movie, one we used to watch several times when she was younger.
    In the movie Lion King 1:. there is a part in the movie where Simba has given up and is crying out to his father asking what he should do and Mufasa's voice roared in the sky... Remember Who You Are.....
    
    At that moment I pulled her face towards me and told her
    "Mama, remember who you are... You are the daughter of a resilient mum who against all odds has had to overcome all forms of obstacles, You are the grand daughter of a woman who went for a masters
    degree at the age of 50
    You are the great grand daughter of a woman who was the chair lady of Maendeleo ya wanawake....
    You are a sum totall of all these women and so much more and you have resilience at the fabric of your being. And if mama made it, you will make it."
    
    As she dried her eyes, she looked at me sniffling and said...thanks mum, I will make it
    
    Lessons I have learnt through this journey
    1. Watch movies with your kids and help them articulate the lessons and values. Ask them the character they have identified with and why
    
    2. When all your knowledge runs out Be still, seek wisdom.
    
    3. Life lessons come from moments and events we least expect to teach us, so trust the process.
    
    4. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity. Help your kids grow it.
    
    As Sandra the Resilience Builder I always say:
    Where there is a will, there is a way

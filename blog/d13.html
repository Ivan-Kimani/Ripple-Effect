<p class="post-text">
    Daughter: Mum, you why didn’t you come for my school meeting? All parents were there.  
    Me: but I sent your brother to represent me.
    Daughter: It is not the same. She said sulking.
    This statement was like a hard slap across my face.
    There are some duties as a single parent you cannot delegate and that is your kids’ milestones. Such milestones are first day of school, parent teacher meeting, awards day, back to school days, pick up from school days, sick days, sports days…etc. In as much as these days do not come often, they have consequences that are not so positive.
    
    The other day I heard people were taking leave for two weeks and more and I thought to myself I should do the same. Upon enquiring with the relevant parties, I was made aware that I have no leave days left. I felt terrible since in my head I had not taken any leave.
    
    But wait, I had taken a few leave days. To do what exactly? to be there for the kids since like I said there are some duties as a single parent you just cannot delegate.
    
    This is me hoping that I am not the only one wishing that single parents should get some support when it comes to days that require them to be with their kids. Plus, they still need one or two days to just take actual leave to relax and recharge.

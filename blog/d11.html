<h2 class="sub-heading">What Jump-starts You?</h2>
<p class="post-text">
   </p>

<p class="post-text">
    The past two months have been plagued with feelings of sadness and despair. You know how you stop hearing anything when you put your head inside the pool? That dead silence that follows? That was me. The irony of it all nothing drastic had happened but I found myself not present to anything around me. I went through the motions went to work, talked to friends, parented and the only prayer I could summon, was ", God you know".

    Life had been knocked out of me, the strength to fight back had gone. Normally I put on a song and dance but no song was working. My 15yr old came from school, she gave me one look and uttered "mum you are not okay", and the rest chimed in eeeehe she is not ok. No amount of am okay was working.
    
    She sat me down and gave me a lecture I am not about to forget. She held me as I cried and her final words to me were: "mum, we know when you are not okay, so don't try to be brave with us, we are here for you". Coincidentally a friend called me and said" Sandra we need to jump start you, you are always there for us it's our turn to take care of you.
    Needless, to say, I have bounced back and am here to tell you:
    1. Asking for help is the bravest thing you can do
    2. Get support from those around you, to get back in this race called life.
    3. There is freedom in surrender, you don't have to always be brave! 
    4. Get that person, song, quote, place or activity that jump starts you.
    
    As always Where there is a Will there is a way

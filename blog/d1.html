<h2 class="sub-heading">Mum What do You Want ?</h2>
<p class="post-text">
   </p>

<p class="post-text">
    As I sat with my daughter waiting for her school bus, she looked thoughtful and asked;
    Daughter: Mum if this was your last day on earth what would you do?
    I excitedly responded
    Me: I would go and buy you guys everything you have always wanted and asked me to get you, but I couldn’t afford. Take you to places you have wished to go. Then I would go to my favorite spot which is by the beach and wait for the end to come.
    She looked at me and said, “but mum there is nothing you have said there that is yours”
    Me: what do you mean, that is everything I would ever want.
    She looked at me not amused and said: I would not want all that because there is nothing there for you.
    
    As she left for school I mused over her question, what do I want. I was very blank, and it scared the daylights out of me.
    All I have ever known is to be there for them and sacrifice all of me for them.
    
    Word of advice, take time to reach inside and take stock. Even though you are there for everyone else, spouse, kids, works, parents etc. Find time for you and find you in the mess. 
    What do you want?

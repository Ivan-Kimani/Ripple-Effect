<h2 class="sub-heading">Mom, That's not Your Child.</h2>
<p class="post-text">

<p class="post-text">
    The other day we were in the supermarket with my teens and across the aisle I heard a kid shout.

    Kid: mum I want this one, I want it, I must have it.
    Mum: No, I have said No....she said frustrated....
    The kid started screaming at the top of her lungs.
    
    My kids started looking at me with those eyes that say mum don’t do it....
    My eldest son whispered, “mum that is not your child”. 
    It’s like he read my thoughts, because in my head I was thinking, if that was you right now… we would leave the supermarket with your ear in my hand.
    
    You must understand am old school. And I know these days we have naughty corners. I will not disclose my take on naughty corners lest am stoned.
    
    Today I want to take us through something called Delayed gratification. This it the ability to delay immediate pleasure to achieve a long-term goal. It is often described as a measure of self-control and self-discipline.
    
    My fellow parents, I want you to underline the two key things you will teach your child.
    Self-control and self-discipline. 
    Why you ask?
    Imagine your son or daughter 20 years from now if you start teaching delayed gratification.
    1. Your child can resist temptation and make decisions based on long -term goals
    2. Your child can weigh the pros and cons of different options, and make decisions that are in their best interest
    3. It will also lead to healthier behaviors, such as avoiding impulse buying, overeating, overreacting, engaging in self destructive behavior just to get what they want, sticking it out in a hard situation when things get rough e.g., jobs, relationships, schools, and life in general.
    
     In other words, they will Build Resilience. These are the people we also want to employ within our organizations.
    
    Enough with the lessons, on our drive back home, my kids started saying….
    Ingekua sisi kama tuko watoi back in the day (if it was us doing such back in the days), tungeona(we would see the) supermarket or the mall after one month. They all laughed out loud…
    
    Something to ponder, do you practice delayed gratification?
    Will you at least consider teaching your child delayed gratification?
    
    As Sandra the Resilience Builder I always say,
     Where there is a Will, there is a Way.

    Before you go jumping and volunteering to be my man, first read the fine print...

My kids wish me a Happy Mother's Day and Happy Father's Day as well. Playing mum and dad as is not a walk in the park. Trying to be a dad to a son is even harder and I have made many many mistakes along the way. I gave birth at a early age and I happened to give birth to a boy first, raising him has been hit and miss.

When he was younger, I found him sitting in the toilet to pee like mum does. It hit me hard, so I taught him how to hold and pee.

When he got into his first fight, I ran out to beat the other kid.

When he got his first girlfriend, I was there cheering him on and teaching him how to be a good man, “the gospel according to Sandra heheheee.”

The other day he came home, I sensed he was very sad. I probed for a week, and he didn't utter a word. When he realized his mama will not relent, he sat me down and said,

Son: I am heartbroken, my girlfriend has left me.

Now I know the true meaning of don't mess with a lioness curb. I went on a rant, how could she do that, what gives her the right...does she know you are a good man....on and on I continued blabbering until I realized he was not listening.

He just gave me one disappointed look and said
Son: mum, you are not a man, you wouldn't understand.

My fellow single mothers of sons, the boy might as well have slapped me right across my face it would have been less painful.
Before you go judging my son, in his defence, "there I go again" he was right.
There are some things as a woman I can't give him or teach him as a man would. Reality check ladies, very hard bitter pill to swallow!

Lesson learnt:
1. My son needs a male mentor, help!
2. I can't teach my son to be a man coz I not a man.
3. Father figures are needed

Anyone else's son needs a mentor? Raise your glasses and say I!

To all male mentors, this one's for you.
Here is hoping one of you will rise to the occasion and be there for our sons.

As Sandra the Resilience Builder I always say:
Where there is a will, there is a way...

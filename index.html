            <h3 >Coach Sandra -<span>The single mum Coach</span></h3>
        
            <p>I am Coach Sandra, an experienced and certified single-mum coach with over 10
                years of dedicated expertise in supporting single mums through their transformative
                journeys. My personal journey has been one of triumph over tribulations, a path
                carved by mistakes and growth, and a testament to the power of resilience. As a
                single parent who has faced daunting obstacles, wrestled with darkness, and
                emerged stronger, I am dedicated to guiding you towards a life of empowerment and
                fulfillment. Let me help you embrace your true potential and build a life that radiates
                resilience and empowerment.
            </p>
<br>

            <h3>Why Coach Sandra?</h3>
            <p>I am not just a coach. I am your ally, your confidante, and your source of unwavering
                support. Through my own experiences, I have navigated the tumultuous waters of
                single parenthood, surmounted heartache, and triumphed over seemingly
                insurmountable odds. I have raised three incredible children while juggling work,
                personal growth, and the myriad of roles life has thrown my way.</p>
<br>
                <h3>Coach Sandra's Jouney</h3>
                <p>My coaching philosophy centers on the belief that every single parent possesses an
                    innate ability to rise above adversity. Through the right mindset and attitude, you can
                    emerge from life&#39;s trials stronger and more resilient than before. I provide a safe and
                    nonjudgmental space for you to explore your fears, dreams, and aspirations.
                    Together, we&#39;ll uncover the tools you need to rebuild, transform, and thrive.</p>

            I met Sandra (to me Wanjiku) when my life has been turned upside down and everything was painted a very venomous black. Lost my income during covid 19 season which threw me in total dependence on my husband and that did not go well as he lost his job 6 months later.
            <br>
            She played and prayed a very major role in my turn around. I was slowly sinking into depression and life was slowly turning useless. God used her to paint the brick picture into a colored mirage and I slowly turned from a low self esteem to believing myself all over again and regaining my self worth.
            <br> 
            Wanjiku to me is a combination of so many things. A prayer warrior, a no nonsense girl who gives you as it is, very honest and yet able to connect  emotionally with a lot of people. That's Wanjiku to me.

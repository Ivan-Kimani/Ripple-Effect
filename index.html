<p class="test">
  I met Sandra (to me Wanjiku) when my life has been turned upside down and everything was painted a very venomous black. Lost my income during covid 19 season which threw me in total dependence on my husband and that did not go well as he lost his job 6 months later.
  <br>
  She played and prayed a very major role in my turn around. I was slowly sinking into depression and life was slowly turning useless. God used her to paint the brick picture into a colored mirage and I slowly turned from a low self esteem to believing myself all over again and regaining my self worth.
  <br> 
  Wanjiku to me is a combination of so many things. A prayer warrior, a no nonsense girl who gives you as it is, very honest and yet able to connect  emotionally with a lot of people. That's Wanjiku to me.

  To start off, I met Sandra back in 2016 when she moved into our apartment block. After a while, we met and introduced ourselves and henceforth became good friends. Our children at that time were still very young and they also were good friends.
<br>
  One afternoon, Sandra invited me over for a cup of tea in her house and of course w e got talking about life issues and the things that ail us, it is then that I realized that she has this innate ability to just listen deeply and mirror back what you are saying… This was very reflective and what I noted after having a few tea times together, my life was improving because our talks were helping me understand my life better and hence helping me make better choices.
  <br>
  She spoke to my inner child and she also helped me become vulnerable with myself and accept who I am. I also love the fact that she is not judgemental and she is genuinely concerned with my progress as a person. She is out to help me live a wholesome life as a mum and as a woman and I am very grateful for the input she has had in my life.
